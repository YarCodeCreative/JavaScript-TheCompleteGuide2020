JAVASCRIPT VS TYPESCRIPT
    -
    
a function does not need to end with a semi-colon

Any user input recieved from an HTML element will always be a string.

Converting Data Types:
    -You can use parseInt or + to convert a string to an integer
    -ex: parseInt(userInput.value);  OR   +(userInput.value);
    -useing the + sign does not allow you to specify what kind of number you want

Special Operators:
    -currentResult = currentResult + enteredNumber; is the same as currentResult += enteredNumber;
    -currentResult++ is the same as currentResult + 1
    -currentResult-- is the same as currentResult - 1
    -I you write it like this: --currentResult
        if the operators are before the variable, it will return the value before the changes.
        if its after, it will return the value after the changes.
